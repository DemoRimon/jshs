API is the protocol of conversation between two languages, webapp, mobileapp, mobileapp-webapp, servers etc. We talk with people and receive some sign or word as response which acts as our protocol of the conversation such as: Hi, which means greeting. Similarly, API acts as protocol by sending various things and asking responses from other senders like if someone is using google to login into a webpage, the webpage will expect a token or proof of execution of login as token.

API also acts as the data sent or received from others. For example, if I request data from a weather app, it will send me the data and it will be API.

API can be interpretated as a contract between the offering agent and receiving agent. It offers various features based on the contract, that is, offers various options based on the data.

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of features and rules that exist inside a software program (the application) enabling interaction with it through software - as opposed to a human user interface. The API can be seen as a simple contract (the interface) between the application offering it and other items, such as third-party software or hardware.

In Web development, an API is generally a set of code features (e.g. methods, properties, events, and URLs) that a developer can use in their apps for interacting with components of a user's web browser, other software/hardware on the user's computer, or third-party websites and services.
