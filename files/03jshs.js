/*
// Github setup

● When we create a codespace in github, a computer instance is being made for the user.

● "add dev container configuration files" adds some configuration files to the computer instance that gives the runtime for node.js, python etc.

● As we have limited hours of coding in github, we have to delete the active machine(computer instance) from codespaces.

● For saving files in github, we have to first commit and then push.
